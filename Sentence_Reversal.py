# ProblemÂ¶
# Given a string of words, reverse all the words. For example:

# Given:

# 'This is the best'

# Return:

# 'best the is This'

# As part of this exercise you should remove all leading and trailing whitespace. So that inputs such as:

# '  space here'  and 'space here      '

# both become:

# 'here space'


# Solution
# We could take advantage of Python's abilities and solve the problem with the use of split() and some slicing or use of reversed:

def rev_word1(s):
    return " ".join(reversed(s.split()))

#Or

def rev_word2(s):
    return " ".join(s.split()[::-1])
